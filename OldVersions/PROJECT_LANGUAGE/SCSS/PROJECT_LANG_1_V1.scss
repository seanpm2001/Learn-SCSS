* About:
* I decided to make SCSS the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-SCSS) as SCSS is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the SCSS programming language. It only makes sense to SCSS the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
